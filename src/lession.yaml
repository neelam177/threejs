1️⃣ What is WebGL & Three.js

Meaning:
WebGL is a browser API that uses the GPU to render 2D and 3D graphics. Three.js is a JavaScript library that makes WebGL easier to use.

2️⃣ Making a cube as quick as possible

Meaning:
Creating a basic 3D cube to understand the minimum setup required in Three.js.

3️⃣ Understanding the parts

Meaning:
Learning the core components of Three.js such as scene, camera, geometry, material, mesh, and renderer.

4️⃣ Transformations

Meaning:
Moving, rotating, and scaling 3D objects.

5️⃣ Animations

Meaning:
Changing object properties over time to create motion.

6️⃣ Setting up Vite

Meaning:
Using Vite to quickly set up a modern and fast development environment.

7️⃣ Making responsive

Meaning:
Adjusting the canvas and camera when the browser window size changes.

8️⃣ Orbit Controls

Meaning:
Allowing users to rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D scene using the mouse.

9️⃣ Geometries

Meaning:
Defining the shape of 3D objects such as boxes, spheres, and planes.

🔟 Textures

Meaning:
Applying images to 3D objects to give them a realistic surface appearance.

1️⃣1️⃣ Materials

Meaning:
Defining how objects look and react to light, including color, shine, and reflections.

1️⃣2️⃣ lil-gui

Meaning:
Using a graphical control panel to adjust values in real time during development.

1️⃣3️⃣ Lights

Meaning:
Illuminating the 3D scene to make objects visible and realistic.

1️⃣4️⃣ Adding 3D Models

Meaning:
Loading and displaying external 3D models like GLTF or GLB files in the scene.
